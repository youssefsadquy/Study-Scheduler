The purpose of this use case is to allow the user to create their own schedule plan so that they can view it. The functional requirement this meets is "The system will provide for manual adjustment of the study schedule dates and times". The primary user is the student and the system to update the calendar.

## :mag_right: Use case two

### Use case name
Student wishes to mark their daily tasks as complete.
### Purpose
The end goal of this use case is to allow students to mark any daily tasks that they have completed easily, to allow them to better manage their time and have a stronger understanding of outstanding work when planning future tasks. It would also be benificial as it would also allow the application to understand which tasks are outstanding when planning a timetable for the student.

### Related requirements
This satisfies many of our functional requirement, specifically "The system must adjust the user's study schedule when daily tasks are not complete". This is because in order to alter the study schedule to be more efficient the system must know which tasks are and are not outstanding. Another functional requirement that is satisfied is "Each day the system will notify the user of their daily tasks to complete". This is because once again to help students stay on top of work these notifications are necassary and cannot be accurate unless the user can mark completed tasks.
### Actors involved
who are the primary/secondary actors for this use case?
### Priority
This use case must be implemented as a substantial goal of our system is to keep users on top of their workload and allow them to ensure that they can plan their timetables accurately and efficiently. Without being able to manage which tasks are and aren't complete the user wouldn't be able to keep track of tasks anywhere near as easily. Providing notifications of incomplete work is also a huge benifit as the user cannot accidentally forget or get confused with deadlines. Constant daily reminders also ensures that the students are always aware of their workload, mitigating the chances of them putting it off, or procrastinating.
